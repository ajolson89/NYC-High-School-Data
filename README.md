# NYC-High-School-Data

This project looks into SAT scores as well as other relevant information from NYC schools. 

The data for this project can be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4

Project objectives involved combining multiple sources of data, merging into a combined dataframe and cleaning up the data to be useable. 

After the data was cleaned, various plots were generated to derive relationships and meaning from the data.
